## One toolbox, two flavours

This is release VERNUM of STK, published on PUBDATE, and it comes in two flavours:

 * an "all purpose" release, which is suitable for use both with [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and with [Matlab](www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).
 * an Octave package, for people who want to install and use STK as a regular [Octave package](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Packages.html#Packages).
